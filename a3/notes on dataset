The size of each image should be 56 px x 56 px
All of them are squares- just resizing them should be fine.
Images rotated by 45 degrees have parts of the sample cut off. Could present a problem in training. 
No efficient way to fix them for now. 
Only the first 60 need to be rotated.
Will check the labels tonight.
