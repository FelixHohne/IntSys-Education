I should have committed more, in hindsight. This is too long for a commit comment, so now this hopefully unobtrusive text file exists.
A2 Status as of 12:09AM CST 3/27/2019:
    -Log Loss is done, needs testing
    -Indices were added to DS1, DS2, DS3, DS4 for easy data visualisation/finding things/indicing. 
    -data_loader is done- though frankly, there wasn't much to do on my end
    -test file is now much messier than when I got it:
        -Basic Data Visualisation: There is commented out code for a 2D Scatterplot for DS2 and looking at just two dimensions of DS1, DS2, and DS3. 
         There is also commented out code for a 3D Scatterplot for DS1, DS3, and DS4 to look at overall trends. Yall will have to change the filepath, though- 
         my computer is dumb and wouldn't use the normal filepath -_- Also, don't forget to change the indices- 3D plots for DS1, DS2, and DS3 should be fine, 
         but the index for the target (and the inputs) is different in DS2.
        -Copy pasted the tester from linear_regression. Suffering from same issue as earlier. Will debug later when I am not tired.
    -linear_regression loss functions have been tested- they work perfectly.
    -To be done: test log loss function- will have to figure this out later. Also, finish linear_regression debugging.
